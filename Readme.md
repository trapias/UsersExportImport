# UsersExportImport

UsersExportImport is a DNN module that allows to export/import users, user profiles properties and roles to DotNetNuke from CSV/XML files. This is simple and fast way to create your users.

## This is a fork
This is a fork of the original "DotNetNuke Users Export/Import Tool" project on CodePlex at [https://usersexportimport.codeplex.com/](https://usersexportimport.codeplex.com/ "https://usersexportimport.codeplex.com/").

###What's new
I added a Settings control to the module to be able to configure the **CSV separator** (original code uses comma as separator, while in Italy a semicolon is normally used).

The included DLL is compiled on **.Net 4** and references **DNN 7.1.1**, but of course you can compile on less recent versions of both if needed.
